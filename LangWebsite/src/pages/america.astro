                    <p class="py-2">What is the American dream?</p>
                    <p class="py-2">Conceptually, not very difficult to grasp. The American dream lies in the ideals of freedom, equality, and opportunity for each and every American. The idea is that anyone, regardless of their background, can attain their own version of success in society where upward mobility is available to all.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">The American dream is believed to be achieved through self-sacrifice, risk-taking, and hard work, rather than chance.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">The American dream was influenced by the Declaration of Independence, where it is stated that all people are created equal in America, and all people have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
