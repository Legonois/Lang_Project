                <p class="py-10 mt-2 text-lg text-gray-600">The 2013 adaptation of the Great Gastby brings the critique of the American Dream to life with a distint visual style. The movie, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby, Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway, and Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan, captures the decadence and disillusionment of the Roaring Twenties.</p>

                    <p class="py-2">The movie's opulent parties at Gatsby's mansion, depicted with a stunning visual style, embody the outragous wealth of the era. The extravagant visuals highlight the superficiality of the characters, enhancing the critique of the American Dream.</p>

                    <p class="py-2">The performances of the A list actors within the movie bring debth to the characters. The A list casting also has symbolism within the movie. DiCaprio's Gatsby is both ambitious and tragically flawed, while Mulligan's Daisy is enchanting yet shallow, mirroring their roles in the decay of the Dream.</p>

                    <p class="py-2">Luhrmann's adaptation adds another dimension to the story of The Great Gatsby. The film's visual and audio elements enhance the atmosphere of disillusionment and excess found within the original novel, capturing the essence of Fitzgerald's exploration of the American Dream's corruption. While the film stays faithful to the plot and characters, its unique cinematic approach provides a fresh perspective on the timeless themes of the novel.</p>
