                    <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">The American Dream</h1>
                    <p class="py-2">What is the American dream?</p>
                    <p class="py-2">Conceptually, it's not very difficult to grasp. The American dream lies in the ideals of freedom, equality, and opportunity for each and every American. The idea is that anyone, regardless of their background, can attain their own version of success in society where upward mobility is available to all.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">The American dream is believed to be achieved through self-sacrifice, risk-taking, and hard work, rather than chance.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">The American dream was influenced by the Declaration of Independence, where it is stated that all people are created equal in America, and all people have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>

                    <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl ">The potrayal of the American Dream</h1>
                    <p class="py-2">The Great Gatsby paints a vivid picture of the corruption of the American Dream during the Roaring Twenties.</p>
                    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg py-2">Unobtainibility</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">The green light at the end of Daisy's dock is a representation of the American Dream, as it is something that is distant, elusive, and ultimately unattainable.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">For Jay Gatsby, it represents his desire for Dasiy, which was never realized. This unattainability highlights the hollowness and futility of the Dream. By the end of the novel, Gatsby is not the only one reaching for the unabtainable green light, but everyone, as described by Nick in Chapter 9. We all hope to reach it, tomorrow or the next day or the day after that. But it will forever be unobtainable for Gastby</p>
                    <p class="py-2 italic">"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us.<strong> It eluded us then,</strong> but that’s no matter—<strong> we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....</strong> And then one fine morning—So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."</p>
                    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg py-2">Moral Decay</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">The valley of ashes seen in the novel represents the moral decay of society. The Vally, as a desolate land of ash and dust, represents the decay within society as the result of the uninhibited pursuit of wealth.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">The eyes of Doctor Eckleburg, staring down at the valley, symbolizes the fading spirital values in the face of materialism during the roaring 20s</p>
                    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg py-2">Persuit of Wealth</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">The persuit of wealth by the characters depicted in the Great Gatsby leads to the corruption of the American Dream</p>
                    <p class="py-2">The actions they partake in, particularly dishonesty, infidelity, and recklessness demonstrate the decay and corruption of the American Dream during the roaring 20s. Values once defined by the American Dream no longer matter to the characters, as they continue to reach for more wealth and higher social standing.</p>

                    <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl text-center">T.S. Eliot's "The Hollow Men"</h1>
                    <p class="py-2 italic">A poem written in 1925, potreys the theme of disillusionment.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">The hollow men seen within the poem "The Hollowed Men" that are "stuffed with straw" represent the spiritual emptiness of modern life. Much like how Fitzgerald's characters represent the moral emptiness of a society fixated on wealth and status. </p>
                    <p class="py-2"> Both works express the Modernist era's disillusionment as traditional values gave way to materialism and how the American Dream became corrupted and crumbled.</p>
